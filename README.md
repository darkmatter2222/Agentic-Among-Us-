# Agentic Among Us

An AI-powered simulation of **Among Us** where autonomous LLM-driven agents play as Crewmates and Impostors. Watch AI agents navigate The Skeld, complete tasks, form alliances, spread rumors, and (eventually) eliminate each other—all powered by large language models.

## What Is This?

This project creates a fully autonomous Among Us simulation where:
- **8 AI agents** (6 Crewmates, 2 Impostors) make real-time decisions using LLM reasoning
- Agents have **memory systems** tracking observations, suspicions, and conversations
- Natural **speech and social interactions** between agents
- Full **pathfinding and collision avoidance** on The Skeld map
- Real-time **visualization** via React + PixiJS client

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22 LTS** or newer
- **npm 10+**
- **LLM Server**: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct running via llama.cpp Docker (see [`docker-manage/`](./docker-manage/README.md))

## LLM Server Setup

The simulation requires a local LLM server for AI agent decisions. We use **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct** (Q4_K_M quantization) running in Docker with CUDA:

```powershell
# From docker-manage directory
.\deploy.ps1
```

This downloads the model and starts llama.cpp on port 8080. See [`docker-manage/README.md`](./docker-manage/README.md) for full setup instructions.

**Performance**: ~180 tokens/sec on RTX 3090, ~300-400ms per agent decision.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev:all` | Start both Fastify server (port 4000) and Vite client (port 5173) |
| `npm run dev:server` | Run only the server workspace (`@agentrunner/server`) |
| `npm run dev:client` | Run only the React client |
| `npm --workspace @agentrunner/server run probe` | Execute a headless simulation run to verify the engine |

## Build & Lint

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Type-check shared/server, then build the client bundle |
| `npm run lint` | Lint client, server, and shared TypeScript sources |

## Tests & Smoke Checks

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite across shared/server packages |
| `npm run test:watch` | Watch mode for the test suite during development |
| `npm run smoke:test` | Launch full stack, poll `/health`, then shut down when ready |

---

## Manual QA Checklist

1. Run `npm run dev:all` to start the Fastify simulation server (port 4000) and Vite client (port 5173).
2. Open http://localhost:5173 in a Chromium-based browser and confirm:
   - Agents render on The Skeld map and continue moving for at least 30 seconds.
   - The Agent Activity panel updates without stalling (watch for frozen timestamps).
3. Open the browser devtools console and ensure the WebSocket handshake logs `connected` and periodic heartbeats from `SimulationClient`.
4. Simulate a dropped connection:
   - In devtools, toggle the Network tab to `Offline` for ~5 seconds, then return to `Online`.
   - Verify the console logs a `stale` state followed by a `connected` state after the connection recovers.
5. With the stack still running, open http://localhost:4000/analytics/metrics to view tick timing averages.
6. When finished, stop `npm run dev:all` with `Ctrl+C`.

### AI Agent Decision Types

Agents can pursue these goals based on LLM reasoning:
- `GO_TO_TASK` — Navigate to assigned task
- `WANDER` — Random exploration
- `FOLLOW_AGENT` — Tail another agent
- `AVOID_AGENT` — Stay away from someone
- `BUDDY_UP` — Team up for safety
- `CONFRONT` — Question suspicious behavior
- `SPREAD_RUMOR` — Share suspicions with others
- `DEFEND_SELF` — Provide alibis when accused
- `SPEAK` — General conversation
- `IDLE` — Wait and observe

**Impostor-Only Goals:**
- `KILL` — Eliminate a crewmate
- `HUNT` — Seek isolated targets
- `SELF_REPORT` — Report own kill
- `FLEE_BODY` — Escape after kill
- `CREATE_ALIBI` — Position for cover

### Agent Memory System

Each AI agent maintains a persistent memory that influences their decisions. The memory system provides **timestamped context** to help agents reason about past events:

#### Memory Components
- **Recent Timeline**: Last 15 events (observations + conversations + accusations) merged chronologically with relative timestamps
- **Last Known Locations**: Where each player was last seen (e.g., "Red: Cafeteria (2m ago, walking)")
- **Suspicion Levels**: Tracked per-player with emoji indicators (🔴 VERY SUS, 🟠 Suspicious, 🟡 Slightly sus, 🟢 Trusted)
- **Alibis Claimed**: What alibis players have stated, with verification status

#### Example Memory Context in LLM Prompt
```
=== RECENT HISTORY (what you remember) ===
[2m ago] in Cafeteria Saw Red in Cafeteria (walking)
[1m ago] in Admin Blue said: "I was doing wires in Electrical"
[45s ago] in Electrical Saw Yellow doing task
[30s ago] ⚠️ Green accused Yellow: "saw you near the body"
[just now] in Weapons Pink said: "I finished asteroids"

=== LAST KNOWN LOCATIONS ===
- Red: Cafeteria (2m ago, walking)
- Blue: Admin (1m ago, walking)
- Yellow: Electrical (45s ago, doing task)

=== YOUR SUSPICIONS ===
- Yellow: 🟠 Suspicious (68%) - near body when found; acting nervous
- Green: 🟢 Trusted (35%)
```

This context is included in every LLM decision prompt, giving agents the information they need to make realistic, informed decisions.
